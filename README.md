# react-boilerplate

This is a React boilerplate project that I made while I was learning React. It comes preconfigured with Webpack and it works out-of-the-box without additional setup.

## Commands
### `npm run serve`
Runs `webpack-dev-server` with live-reload so you can code you React apps and preview it in the browser in real-time.

### `npm run build`
Builds a production-ready version of your app in the `dist ` folder. Copy all your files here and deploy it in your server.

### `npm run clean`
Removes the `dist` folder so you can start a build from scratch.
